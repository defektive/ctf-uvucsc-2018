### Vigen√®re
*100 points*

Ciphertext:
`LKAMALZFY MHIKUXZ ZRPVNSGSUX AZJ'T CACX DLOTZFY VRFLS, WSJF BFU. - HRF KHLF`


Enter the cipher key in this format:
`librarian`

\- BashNinja - [@miketweaver](https://twitter.com/miketweaver)

#### Solution

https://www.dcode.fr/vigenere-cipher common dictionary

Noticed the star key made the plain text end in solo

Tried `starwars` as the key


### wargames
*200 points*

Use a Flag from another challange to decrypt the zip.

- fruitcup

#### Solution

Used ukppnrwryeavgtwicfmnrkbnzeqawg from challenge 3

noticed a lot of garbage. so I moved all files into a directory named using the file's sha1sum.

I think this is what i used.
```
for f in *.?in; do sum=`sha1sum $f|cut -d' ' -f 1`; mkdir -p shas/$sum; cp $f shas/$sum/; done;
```

now that i had unique files. I copied out one file from each directory.

```
for f in *; do cp "$f/`ls $f | head -n 1`" ./; done
```

then started looking for anomolies in the text. noticed file sizes were all dupes except `FileGen 106497027.bin`

```
Geheimnis: DAVG EHFF JWIP XASH YI
Umkehrwalze: B
Grundstellung: AAA
Ringstellung: UVU
```
translated
```
Secret: DAVG EHFF JWIP XASH YI
reversing roll: B

Ringstellung: UVU
```

After some googling it was apparent this was an enigma cipher.

used http://enigma.louisedade.co.uk/enigma.html to decrypt

### Save my Files!
*350 points*

I had a picture saved on a flashdrive, but I ignored the "Safely Remove Hardware" warning and unplugged it. Now I cant see my files!

#### Solution

Used TestDisk, it mentioned finding an extfs. so I ran `e2fsk` on it.

```
$ e2fsck copy.img
e2fsck 1.43.9 (8-Feb-2018)
ext2fs_open2: The ext2 superblock is corrupt
e2fsck: Superblock invalid, trying backup blocks...
copy.img was not cleanly unmounted, check forced.

Find the flag hidden in the provided .pcap file.
You can use Wireshark to view the packet.

Key is all lowercase.

#### Solution

- Used wireshark, noticed http requests to a `/secret/` path.
- Exported bytes for each request
- added png extension
- imported pngs into google slides, so could assemble the puzzle drag drop style


### Packets 101

### Coffee Break
*100 points*

I was trying to copy this file over on the command line and I think I messed up the arguments. Now the file won't open. Can you help?

#### Solution
Using `xxd` i could see all the bytes were swapped around

```
dd if=broken.png of=unbroken.png conv=swab
```
